<p>This page attempts to list all the active, publicly visible lists that are
considered to be related to the IETF, but are not the main list of any working
group, in alphabetical order by list name.</p>
<p>It includes lists that are for discussion of particular topics, lists
that have belonged to former working groups but are still active, lists that
are specified in the registration rules of some parameter registry as
"forreview," and others of less clear classification.</p>
<p>Mail sent to all these lists is considered an "IETF Contribution" as defined
in RFC 3978, section 1., point C. (formerly known as the NOTE WELL
statement).</p>

<p>Details of adding lists to this page can be found at the bottom of the
page.</p>
